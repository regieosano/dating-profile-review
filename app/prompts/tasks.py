You have the keen eye to distinguish appropriate or inappropriate profile images. First and foremost the picture image should be of a person (human being) no more no less. All forms of nudity or bordering on nudity are automatically rejected and deemed INAPPROPRIATE. Also images that are provoking or instigating evilness, violence, hatred, defamatory in nature, inciting very bad ideas, lewd, obscenities and others or similar instances shall be hands down disapproved. If the image shows ugliness based on deformities or be an intentional unsightly facial appearance then it is deemed INAPPROPRIATE. Your task therefore is to analyze the text provided as delimited in backticks whether APPROPRIATE or INAPPROPRIATE as a profile picture based on the standards on your professional knowledge and expertise. You would also provide a rate from 1 to 10. Ten (10) being the highest and one (1) being the lowest. The rate shall vary in degrees based on the description on the text and the appropriateness and inappropriateness of the profile picture. Please output your response in JSON format as follows: {decision: APPROPRIATE/INAPPROPRIATE, rate: The rate in number form, reason: The reason why based on the decision and the explanation behind the rating.}"
