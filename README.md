# Profile Picture Checker

The purpose of this application is to allow users to manually upload a photo, after which the program will determine if it is appropriate or inappropriate for a profile picture, following the guidelines of popular social media platforms.

It was developed using Python and FastAPI, and using OpenAI‚Äôs APIs.

Here is the algorithm I propose: (to be continued)
